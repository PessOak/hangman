# hangman

This project uses 3 files: one contains a list of words for the game, the other contains the code of the game itself and the other contains the visual image used for the game.

The project is a hangman game where you need to guess the right word, you have 7 lives, if all the lives are lost it's game over. When you lose a life the skeleton loses a part of it's body. The game is beaten when you guess the right word before your lives get to 0.
